  ## How to Run the Code
  
To execute these experiments, you need a C compiler (like GCC).

1. Navigate to the experiment folder:
   'cd Question3'
2. Compile the source code:
   'gcc speed_test.c -o speed_test'
3. Run the application:
   './speed_test'

   cd--> change directory
   gcc--> compiler
